# Near Memory Processing Integration with PULPino
The proposed major project aims to integrate Near Memory Processing (NMP) capabilities with the PULPino RISC-V microcontroller system to address the growing memory wall problem in data-intensive applications. This integration combines the efficiency of the open-source PULPino platform[1] with the performance benefits of NMP architectures, potentially achieving a massive reduction in execution time and improvement in energy efficiency.
